	abstract = {Historically, humans have cleared many forests for agriculture. While this substantially reduced ecosystem carbon storage, the impacts of these land cover changes on terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) have not been adequately resolved yet. Here, we combine high-resolution datasets of satellite-derived GPP and environmental predictor variables to estimate the potential GPP of forests, grasslands, and croplands around the globe. With a mean GPP of 2.0 kg C m −2 yr −1 forests represent the most productive land cover on two thirds of the total area suitable for any of these land cover types, while grasslands and croplands on average reach 1.5 and 1.8 kg C m −2 yr −1 , respectively. Combining our potential GPP maps with a historical land-use reconstruction indicates a 4.4\% reduction in global GPP from agricultural expansion. This land-use-induced GPP reduction is amplified in some future scenarios as a result of ongoing deforestation (e.g., the large-scale bioenergy scenario SSP4-3.4) but partly reversed in other scenarios (e.g., the sustainability scenario SSP1-1.9) due to agricultural abandonment. Comparing our results to simulations from state-of-the-art Earth System Models, we find that all investigated models deviate substantially from our estimates and from each other. Our maps could be used as a benchmark to reduce this inconsistency, thereby improving projections of land-based climate mitigation potentials.},

	abstract = {The frequency of heatwaves, droughts and their co‐occurrence vary greatly in simulations of different climate models. Since these extremes are expected to become more frequent with climate change, it is important to understand how vegetation models respond to different climatologies in heatwave and drought occurrence. In previous work, six climate scenarios featuring different drought‐heat signatures have been developed to investigate how single versus compound extremes affect vegetation and carbon dynamics. Here, we use these scenarios to force six dynamic global vegetation models to investigate model agreement in vegetation and carbon cycle response to these scenarios. We find that global responses to different drought‐heat signatures vary considerably across models. Models agree that frequent compound hot‐dry events lead to a reduction in tree cover and vegetation carbon stocks. However, models show opposite responses in vegetation changes for the scenario with no extremes. We find a strong relationship between the frequency of concurrent hot‐dry conditions and the total carbon pool, suggesting a reduction of the natural land carbon sink for increasing occurrence of hot‐dry events. The effect of frequent compound hot and dry extremes is larger than the sum of the effects when only one extreme occurs, highlighting the importance of studying compound events. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in the representation of compound hot‐dry event occurrence in climate models propagate to uncertainties in the simulation of vegetation distribution and carbon pools. Therefore, to reduce uncertainties in future carbon cycle projections, the representation of compound events in climate models needs to be improved.},

	abstract = {Background  Forests mitigate climate change by reducing atmospheric CO2-concentrations through the carbon sink in the forest and in wood products, and substitution effects when wood products replace carbon-intensive materials and fuels. Quantifying the carbon mitigation potential of forests is highly challenging due to the influence of multiple important factors such as forest age and type, climate change and associated natural disturbances, harvest intensities, wood usage patterns, salvage logging practices, and the carbon-intensity of substituted products. Here, we developed a framework to quantify the impact of these factors through factorial simulation experiments with an ecosystem model at the example of central European (Bavarian) forests.
Results  Our simulations showed higher mitigation potentials of young forests compared to mature forests, and similar ones in broad-leaved and needle-leaved forests. Long-lived wood products significantly contributed to mitigation, particularly in needle-leaved forests due to their wood product portfolio, and increased material usage of wood showed considerable climate benefits. Consequently, the ongoing conversion of needle-leaved to more broad-leaved forests should be accompanied by the promotion of long-lived products from broad-leaved species to maintain the product sink. Climate change (especially increasing disturbances) and decarbonization were among the most critical factors influencing mitigation potentials and introduced substantial uncertainty. Nevertheless, until 2050 this uncertainty was narrow enough to derive robust findings. For instance, reducing harvest intensities enhanced the carbon sink in our simulations, but diminished substitution effects, leading to a decreased total mitigation potential until 2050. However, when considering longer time horizons (i.e. until 2100), substitution effects became low enough in our simulations due to expected decarbonization such that decreasing harvests often seemed the more favorable solution.
Conclusion  Our results underscore the need to tailor mitigation strategies to the specific conditions of different forest sites. Furthermore, considering substitution effects, and thoroughly assessing the amount of avoided emissions by using wood products, is critical to determine mitigation potentials. While short-term recommendations are possible, we suggest risk diversification and methodologies like robust optimization to address increasing uncertainties from climate change and decarbonization paces past 2050. Finally, curbing emissions reduces the threat of climate change on forests, safeguarding their carbon sink and ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Late-spring frost (LSF) is a critical factor influencing the functioning of temperate forest ecosystems. Frost damage in the form of canopy defoliation impedes the ability of trees to effectively photosynthesize, thereby reducing tree productivity. In recent decades, LSF frequency has increased across Europe, likely intensified by the effects of climate change. With increasing warming, many deciduous tree species have shifted towards earlier budburst and leaf development. The earlier start of the growing season not only facilitates forest productivity but also lengthens the period during which trees are most susceptible to LSF. Moreover, recent forest transformation efforts in Europe intended to increase forest resilience to climate change have focused on increasing the share of deciduous species in forests. To assess the ability of forests to remain productive under climate change, dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) have proven to be useful tools. Currently, however, most state-of-the-art DVMs do not model processes related to LSF and the associated impacts. Here, we present a novel LSF module for integration with the dynamic vegetation model Lund–Potsdam–Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-GUESS). This new model implementation, termed LPJ-GUESS-FROST, provides the ability to directly attribute simulated impacts on forest productivity dynamics to LSF. We use the example of European beech, one of the dominant deciduous species in central Europe, to demonstrate the functioning of our novel LSF module. Using a network of tree-ring observations from past frost events, we show that LPJ-GUESS-FROST can reproduce productivity reductions caused by LSF. Further, to exemplify the effects of including LSF dynamics in DVMs, we run LPJ-GUESS-FROST for a study region in southern Germany for which high-resolution climate observations are available. Here, we show that modeled LSF plays a substantial role in regulating regional net primary production (NPP) and biomass dynamics, emphasizing the need for LSF to be more widely accounted for in DVMs.},

	abstract = {Forest disturbances can cause shifts in boreal vegetation cover from predominantly evergreen to deciduous trees or non-forest dominance. This, in turn, impacts land surface properties and, potentially, regional climate. Accurately considering such shifts in future projections of vegetation dynamics under climate change is crucial but hindered e.g. uncertainties in future 5 disturbance regimes. In this study, we investigate how sensitive future projections of boreal forest dynamics are to additional changes in disturbance regimes. We use the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS to investigate and disentangle the impacts of climate change and intensifying disturbance regimes in future projections of boreal vegetation cover as well as changes in land surface properties such as albedo and evapotranspiration. Our simulations find that warming alone drives shifts towards more densely forested landscapes, and more intense disturbances reduce tree cover in favor of shrubs and grasses, while 10 the interaction between climate and disturbances leads to an expansion of deciduous trees. Our results additionally indicate that warming decreases albedo and increases evapotranspiration, while more intense disturbances have the opposite effect, potentially offsetting climate impacts. Warming and disturbances are thus comparably important agents of change in boreal forests. Our findings highlight future disturbance regimes as a key source of model uncertainty and underscore the necessity of accounting for disturbances-induced effects on vegetation composition and land surface-atmosphere feedback.},
