  abstract = {Abstract               Since its emergence in the 1990s, the science of attributing observed phenomena to human-induced and natural climate drivers has made remarkable progress. To ensure the relevance and uptake of climate impact attribution studies, scientists must effectively engage with stakeholders. This engagement allows stakeholders to pose key questions, which scientists can then substantiate with evidence evaluating the existence of causal links. Although significant advancements have been made in climate impact attribution science, much work remains to understand the varied requirements of different stakeholders for impact attribution findings. This perspective explores the usefulness of stakeholder engagement in climate impact attribution, the challenges it presents, and how it can be made more relevant for addressing societal questions. It advocates for prioritizing stakeholder involvement to achieve greater transparency, legitimacy, and practical application of findings. Such involvement can enhance the societal impact of attribution studies and support informed decision-making in the face of climate change.},

  abstract = {Balancing increasing demand for wood products while also maintaining forest biodiversity is a paramount challenge. Europe's Biodiversity and Forest Strategies for 2030 attempt to address this challenge. Together, they call for strict protection of 10\% of land area, including all primary and old growth forests, increasing use of ecological forestry, and less reliance on monocultural plantations. Using data on country wide silvicultural practices and a new database on strict forest reserves across Europe, we assess how triad forest zoning could help meet these goals. Our analysis reveals that zoning in Europe is overwhelmingly focused on wood production, while there has been little concomitant protection of forests in strict reserves. Moreover, most strict forest reserves are {\textbackslash} 50 ha in size, likely too small to capture the minimum dynamic area necessary to sustain many taxa. We outline research priorities to meet future demands for timber while minimizing the impact on native biodiversity.},
