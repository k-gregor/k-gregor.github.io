I offer various courses from the realm of software engineering to scientific groups.
Courses can be in-person or online, and they usually consist of a presentation part and a workshop part, but can be fully customized to your needs.
I have so far given courses at:
- Technical University of Munich
- University of California, Berkeley

Do not hesitate to reach out and we can discuss potential courses for your group! Just write me an [e-mail](mailto:konstantin.gregor@posteo.de).
