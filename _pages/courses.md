I offer various courses from the realm of software engineering to scientific groups.
The topics of the courses can be adjusted to your particular needs but have so far encompassed:

- Version control with `git` for scientists
- Best practices for coding in science
- Using the command line and bash scripting to speed up scientific workflows
- Using Docker to make research reproducible

Zoom offers the possibility to hold these courses online. Courses usually consist of a presentation part and a workshop part, but can be fully customized to your needs.
I have so far given courses at:
- Technical University of Munich
- University of California, Berkeley

Please do not hesitate to reach out and we can discuss potential courses for your group!
