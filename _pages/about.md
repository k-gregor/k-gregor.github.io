Hi there! My name is Konstantin, I am a fourth year PhD student at Technical University of Munich. I combine vegetation and climate modeling with robust optimization to investigate options for climate change mitigation, adaptation, and ecosystem service provision under uncertain future climate. It is my hope that this research may help develop forward looking strategies for forest management, agriculture and other disciplines.
