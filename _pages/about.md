Hi there, my name is Konstantin! After studies in mathematics and computer science and six years in the software development industry, I changes paths to work in climate science. Now, I am a fourth year PhD student at Technical University of Munich. I combine vegetation and climate modeling with robust optimization to investigate options for climate change mitigation, adaptation, and ecosystem service provision under uncertain future climate. It is my hope that this research may help develop forward looking strategies for forest management, agriculture and other disciplines.
