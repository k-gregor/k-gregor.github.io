Hi there, my name is Konstantin! After studies in mathematics and computer science and six years in the software development industry, I changed paths to work in climate science. In my PhD, I combined vegetation and climate modeling with robust optimization to investigate options for climate change mitigation, adaptation, and ecosystem service provision under uncertain future climate.
Furthermore, I offer courses in software engineering for scientists.
