      description:
        - I used vegetation models and robust multi-criteria optimization to develop strategies for climate-smart forestry under uncertainty. Namely, forests should help mitigate climate change, and provide numerous ecosystem services (e.g., timber provision, local climate regulation, or habitat provision), while they also need to be adapted to withstand global change.

      items:
        - How can we improve the mitigation potential of ecosystems while adapting them to global change and sustaining ecosystem service provision, all under the wide uncertainty of climate change projections?
    - title: Ecosystem services
      items:
        - Global ecosystems provide numerous ecosystem services to humankind yet they are often optimized for single services (e.g., forestry is often solely aimed at maximizing timber provision). However, ecosystems should be managed taking all these services into account"
